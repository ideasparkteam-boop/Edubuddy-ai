 🧱 How I Built It

I created this app alone doing:
- UI/UX  
- Material design  
- Prompt engineering  
- AI personality setup  
- Logic flow  

I used DeepSeek AI to generate fast and accurate student explanations.  
I used Lovable to design UI, animations, and deploy the app.

The most difficult part was guiding the AI to behave like a real teacher, explain concepts clearly, correct students, generate practice questions, and maintain a friendly tone.
